# LighterOTC White Paper

## Overview
**LighterOTC** is a secure Over-The-Counter (OTC) escrow platform for buying and selling **Lighter Points**. Built with trust, and user protection at its core, LighterOTC ensures that OTC trades are executed safely and efficiently.

## Why LighterOTC?

### üîê Multisig Escrow Security
LighterOTC uses a **multisignature wallet** system including:
- **Pasta Capital**
- **Sigmasquared**

This ensures that no single party can access or move funds independently.

### üí∞ Fair & Transparent Fees
- **1.5% of collateral from the buyer**
- **1.5% of collateral from the seller**

Fees are applied when placing a bid or ask.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Trade**  
   Reach out through our Telegram channel and @rijk0x with trade details in the following format: Selling/Buying: XXX | Type: Points/Tokens| Name: Lighter Points/Tokens | Size: Points Quantity and $ per point.

3. **Deposit Collateral**  
   Both parties deposit funds into the multisig escrow wallet.

4. **Verification**  
   Assets are verified, and terms are confirmed.

5. **TGE**  
   Shortly after TGE, funds are released securely. If the seller fails to uphold their end of the agreement ‚Äî such as not transferring points after TGE ‚Äî the buyer will receive both parties' collateral as compensation.

## Our Mission
*LighterOTC aims to strengthen the **Lighter ecosystem** with a trustworthy OTC solution. In short: Creating a Lighter community and a safe OTC platform.*
