# LighterOTC White Paper

## Overview
**LighterOTC** is a secure Over-The-Counter (OTC) escrow platform for buying and selling **Lighter Points**. Built with trust, and user protection at its core, LighterOTC ensures that OTC trades are executed safely and efficiently.

## Why LighterOTC?

### üîê Multisig Escrow Security
LighterOTC uses a **multisignature wallet** system including:
- **Pasta Capital**
- **Sigmasquared**
- **Bobdbldr**

This ensures that no single party can access or move funds independently.

### üí∞ Fair & Transparent Fees
- **1.5% of collateral from the buyer**
- **1.5% of collateral from the seller**
- **For example, if you buy or sell $1,000 worth of Lighter Points, the fee would be $15 (1.5% of the collateral)**

Fees are applied when placing a bid or ask or requesting to fill a bid or ask. Fees are **non refundable** when: Your bid/ask is filled and you want to cancel your bid/ask. Your fee is also non refundable when trying to manipulate the other buyer or seller and Rijk0x. When you cancel a bid or ask, (that is not filled) you will need to wait 48 hours before placing another bid or ask. It is allowed to higher your bid, or lower your ask. It is not allowed to lower your bid or higher your ask. If you cannot uphold to these rules the fee is **non refundable**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Initiate Trade**  
Reach out through our Telegram channel and @rijk0x with trade details in the following format: Selling/Buying: XXX | Type: Points/Tokens| Name: Lighter Points/Tokens | Size: Points Quantity and $ per point.

3. **Deposit Collateral**  
   Both parties deposit funds into the multisig escrow wallet.

4. **Verification**  
   Assets are verified, and terms are confirmed.

5. **TGE**  
   Shortly after TGE, funds are released securely. If the seller fails to uphold their end of the agreement ‚Äî such as not transferring points after TGE ‚Äî the buyer will receive both parties' collateral as compensation.
